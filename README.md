# JavaScript Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository! This is where I document my progress as I dive deep into JavaScript, learning modern syntax, APIs, DOM manipulation, and more.

## 📅 Daily Progress
I aim to update this repository daily with new concepts, examples, and mini-projects.

### Structure
- Each day has its own folder (e.g., `Day1`, `Day2`) containing:
  - **Code Snippets**: Examples of concepts learned.
  - **Mini-Projects**: Small practical implementations.
  - **Notes**: Key takeaways and learning points.

## 🗓️ Table of Contents
| Day  | Topic                                | Description                           |
|------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Day 1| Modern Syntax (`let`, `const`, etc.) | Understanding the basics of ES6+      |
| Day 2| DOM Manipulation                    | Interacting with web pages            |
| Day 3| APIs and Fetch                      | Learning how to fetch data            |
| ...  | ...                                  | ...                                   |

## 🛠️ Tools and Resources
- **Code Editor**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Browser DevTools**: Debugging JavaScript in the browser.
